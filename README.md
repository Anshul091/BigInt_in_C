# Introduction
## High-Precision Mathematical Computations in C

This repository showcases a collection of advanced mathematical computations and custom data structures implemented in C. The project includes:

### Key Features

1. **High-Precision Calculation of Pi**: 
   - Computed the value of Ï€ up to 10,000 decimal places using the Chudnovsky Algorithm, with the capability to compute to theoretically infinite places.

2. **Mathematical Algorithms and Methods**:
   - Implemented the Newton-Raphson method for root-finding and constructed algorithms for various complex mathematical computations.

3. **Custom Data Structures**:
   - Developed a `BigInt` library capable of handling very large integers, a `Complex` number library for complex arithmetic, and a `Fraction` class for rational number operations.
   - Supports various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, factorial, square root, and more.

4. **Versatile and Efficient**:
   - The self-designed data structures can handle any integer range, perform computations with complex numbers, and manage large fractional values seamlessly.

This project is a powerful toolkit for developers and mathematicians interested in high-precision calculations and algorithmic computations in C.
